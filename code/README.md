## Code

This folder contains data cleaning and analysis code. While each experiment utilized the same data cleaning process in principle, the code was modified in each case to fit the requirements of each experiment's dataset. Specifically, R scripts with the `JSON_convert_*` prefix involve converting the JSON output from breadboard into tabular data, while R scripts with the `localginietal*` prefix involve data cleaning and pre-processing prior to analysis.

The final analysis code for figures and analysis presented in the manuscript is found in `final/data_analysis.qmd.` A PDF version is also provided for reference.
