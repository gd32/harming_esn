## Summary

In this analysis, we see if the cooperation dynamics found in Rand et. al's paper "Spontaneous giving and calculated greed" hold in our experimental datasets. In the paper they put forth two competing hypotheses: one where faster decisions are less cooperative, and the other where faster decisions are more cooperative. They verify this using the following correlative and causal approaches:

- showing that faster decisions are more cooperative than slower ones
- showing that under time pressure, people are more intuitive and are more likely to be cooperative

For our data, we can do the same process by showing that:

1) faster decisions are more likely to be cooperative rather than defection or punishment (or vice versa)

2) under time pressure conditions, people choose to cooperate more or choose reactive behaviors

## Load data

```{r}
#exp1
load("~/Documents/Projects/harming_esn/code/exp1/data1_pc.Rdata")
#exp2
load("~/Documents/Projects/harming_esn/code/exp2/tpdata_pc.Rdata")
```

## Analysis

### Are faster decisions are more likely to be cooperative rather than defection or punishment

We focus this analysis on experiment 2 data since the time pressure condition is only present in that experiment. We split decision times by the median and compare the rate of cooperation:

```{r}
tpdata_pc %>%
  summarize(median_dt = median1(behaviorTime)) 
# The median decision time was 2700ms 

tpdata_pc %>%
  mutate(fast_decision = ifelse(behaviorTime < median1(behaviorTime), 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(fast_decision, behavior) %>%
  filter(is.na(fast_decision) == 0) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(perc = n/sum(n),
         total = sum(n))
```

Among those  below median decision time ("faster"), cooperation occurred 49.9% of the time, while decisions made at or above the median decision time("slower") were cooperative 46.3% of the time.

#### Test for statistical significance

```{r}
prop.test(c(794, 735), c(1592, 1589))
```
The test is statistically significant with p = 0.0448.

#### Regression model for cooperation by speed of decision
```{r}
tpdata_pc = tpdata_pc %>%
  mutate(fast_decision = ifelse(behaviorTime < median1(behaviorTime), 1, 0),
         behavior_punish = ifelse(behavior == "P" & is.na(behavior) == 0, 1, 0),
         behavior_coop = ifelse(behavior == "C" & is.na(behavior) == 0, 1, 0),
         behavior_defect = ifelse(behavior == "D" & is.na(behavior) == 0, 1, 0)) 

m16 = glmer(behavior_coop ~ fast_decision + factor(round) + (1|game) + (1|superid), data = tpdata_pc, family = binomial, nAGQ=0, control = glmerControl(optimizer = c("bobyqa"), optCtrl=list(maxfun=2e5), calc.derivs=FALSE))

# output with p-values
tidy(m16, conf.int=TRUE, exponentiate=TRUE) %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, p.value) %>%
  rename(Term = term, Estimate = estimate, 
         LL = conf.low, UL = conf.high, p = p.value) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 4)) %>%
  select(Term, Estimate, LL, UL, p) %>%
  head(2)
```
After adjusting for clustering and round, cooperation is slightly more likely with a fast decision, though only at a marginally significant level (p = 0.068).

### Under time pressure conditions, do people choose to be more cooperative? more reactive?

```{r}
# All punishment
tpdata_pc %>%
  group_by(tp_on, behavior) %>%
  filter(behavior %in% c("C", "D", "P")) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(perc = n/sum(n),
         total = sum(n))
```

Under time pressure, cooperation occurred 43.3% of the time, compared to 53.0% of the time without time pressure. So in our data, we do not see the same increase in cooperation under time pressure as the Rand group did. However, we notice that the proportion of defections dramatically increased from 23.4% without time pressure to 42.0% with time pressure (both differences are strongly significant).

In the Rand experiments, punishment was not an option - we see in our experiments that time pressure shifts behavioral preference away from punishment (an almost 44% reduction) to defection rather than cooperation; this is a more neutral position as it does not incur a cost upon the ego - thoughts?

#### Testing difference in proportions

```{r}
# Cooperation
prop.test(c(837, 706), c(1580, 1629)) # p<0.0001
# Defection
prop.test(c(370, 684), c(1580, 1629)) # p<0.0001
```
